    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
        <p>Just a handful of every day spices makes an incredible Chicken Shawarma 
            marinade that infuses the chicken with exotic Middle Eastern flavours. 
            The smell when this is cooking is insane!
        </p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>¾ tbsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>¾ tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>¾ tbsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>¾ tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cloves</li>
        <li>½ tsp cayenne pepper, more if you prefer</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large lemon, juice of</li>
        <li>⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Instructions</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the cumin, turmeric, coriander, garlic powder, sweet paprika and cloves. 
            Set aside the shawarma spice mix for now.
        </li>
        <li>Pat the chicken thighs dry and season with salt on both sides, then thinly slice into small 
            bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a large bowl. Add the shwarma spices and toss to coat. Add the onions, 
            lemon juice and olive oil. Toss everything together again. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours 
            or overnight (if you don't have time, you can cut or skip marinating time)
        </li>
        <li>When ready, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Take the chicken out of the fridge and let it 
            sit in room temperature for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the marinated chicken with the onions in one layer on a large lightly-oiled baking sheet pan.
            Roast for 30 minutes in the 425 degrees F heated-oven. For a more browned, crispier chicken, move the pan to 
            the top rack and broil very briefly (watch carefully). Remove from the oven.
        </li>
        <li>While the chicken is roasting, prepare the pita pockets. Make tahini sauce according to this recipe or Tztaziki sauce 
            according to this recipe. Make 3-ingredient Mediterranean salad according to this recipe. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>To serve, open pita pockets up. Spread a little tahini sauce or Tzatziki sauce, add chicken shawarma, arugula, Mediterranean 
            salad and pickles or olives, if you like. Serve immediately!
        </li>
    </ol>
